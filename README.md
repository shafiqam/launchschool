# LaunchSchool Practice Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to practice exercises, designed to help me solidify my understanding of concepts as I progress through LaunchSchool's curriculum.

## Exercise Structure

Exercises are organized into folders by each language course. Each folder typically contains the following:

- **README.md:** This file provides instructions for the setting up the corresponding programming laguage within the folder.
- **Exercise files:** These files are my solutions to each problem within the topic discussed.
- Test files (optional): Some exercises may include test files to help verify the solutions.
